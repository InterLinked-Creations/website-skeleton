# Interlinked Creations: Website Skeleton

This is the basic "skeleton" of the front-end development of my site.

## Currect progress

**Main Canvas:** Everything on this website will be on a single canvas. This allows me to add certain features that are difficult to implement on a basic webpage. This also allows me to keep the page's aspect ratio without having to deal with different screen sizes.
**Intro Page:** I have the basic intro page working just fine. The Start button makes a nice cross-fade to a blank page.
